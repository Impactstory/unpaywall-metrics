          Aren't there already lots of scholarly search tools?

          </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yep. But this one's a little different: there are already plenty of ways for <em>academic researchers</em> to find academic literature&hellip;we‚Äôre building one for <em>everyone else.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          We're aiming to meet the information needs of citizen scientists, patients, K-12 teachers, medical practitioners, social workers, community college students, policy makers, and millions more. What they all have in common: they're folks who'd benefit from access to the scholarly record, but they've historically been locked out. They've had no access to the <strong>content</strong> or the <strong>context</strong> of the scholarly conversation.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="icon">üìë</span>
          <span class="text">
          Problem: it's hard to access <em>content</em>

          </span>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Traditionally, the scholarly literature was paywalled, cutting off access to the content. The Open Access movement is on the way to solving this: <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/4375/">Half of new articles</a> are now free to read somewhere, and that number is growing. The catch is that there are more than 50,000 different "somewheres" on web servers around the world, so we need a central index to find it. No one's done a good job of this yet (Google Scholar gets close, but it's aimed at specialists, not regular people. It's also 100% proprietary, closed-source, closed-data, and
          <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/retired-google-projects">subject to disappearing at Google‚Äôs whim.</a>)
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="icon">üåç</span>
          <span class="text">
          Problem: it's hard to access <em>context</em>

          </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <em>Context</em> is the stuff that makes an article understandable for a specialist, but gobbledegook to the rest of us. So that includes everything from field-specific jargon, to strategies for skimming to key findings, to knowledge of core concepts like p-values. Specialists have access to context. Regular folks don't. This makes reading the scholarly literature like reading Shakespeare without notes: you get glimmers of beauty, but without some help it's mostly just frustrating.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="icon">üí°</span>
          <span class="text">
          Solution: easy access to the <em>content</em> and <em>context</em> of research literature.

          </span>
        </h3>

        <p>
            Our plan: provide access to both <em>content</em> and <em>context,</em> for free, in one place. To do that, we‚Äôre going to bring together an open database of OA papers with a suite of AI-powered support tools we're calling an Explanation Engine.
        </p>

        <p>
          We‚Äôve already finished the database of OA papers. So that's good. With the free <a href="https://unpaywall.org">Unpaywall</a> database, we‚Äôve now got 20 million OA articles from 50k sources, built on
          <a href="https://github.com/Impactstory">open source</a>, available as open data, and with a working nonprofit sustainability model.
        </p>

        <p>
          We‚Äôre building the "AI-powered support tools" now. What kind of tools? Well, let‚Äôs go back to the Hamlet example...today, publishers solve the context problem for readers of Shakespeare by adding notes to the text that define and explain difficult words and phrases. We're gonna do the same thing for 20 million scholarly articles. And that‚Äôs just the start&hellip;we're also working on concept maps, automated plain-language translations (think automatic
          <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Simple Wikipedia</a>), structured abstracts, topic guides, and more. Thanks to recent progress in AI, all this can be automated, so we can do it at scale. That‚Äôs new. And it's big.

          The payoff

        <p>
          When Microsoft launched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC?oldformat=true">Altair BASIC</a> for the new "personal computers," there were already plenty of programming environments for experts. But here was one accessible to <em>everyone else</em>. That was new. And ultimately it launched the PC revolution, bringing computing to everyone's lives. We think it's time that same kind of movement happened in the world of knowledge.
